# EROWLMapper

This sample Java code illustrates an approach to automatically mapping ER schemas to OWL ontologies
presented in [I. Myroshnichenko and M. Murphy, Mapping ER Schemas to OWL Ontologies, IEEE Sixth International Conference on Semantic Computing, Berkeley, CA, 2009](https://www.computer.org/csdl/proceedings/icsc/2009/3800/00/3800a324-abs.html).

The bulk of the mapping logic is located in [domain/logic/mapper/OWLMapper](src/edu/sfsu/ertools/domain/logic/mapper/OWLMapper.java).
